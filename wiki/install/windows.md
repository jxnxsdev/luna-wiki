# Running the Installer on Windows

::: warning
If you have the Microsoft Store version of TidaLuna installed, you need to uninstall it and instead use the Tidal Installer from
[Tidals Website](https://tidal.com/download). The Microsoft Store version is not compatible with TidaLuna.
:::

If you already have the Installer launched, you can skip to [Installing TidaLuna](/install/installing).

## Download the Installer

1. Go to the [TidaLuna Installer Releases](https://github.com/jxnxsdev/TidaLuna-Installer/releases/latest) page.
2. Download the latest `windows-x86_64.zip` file.
3. Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a folder of your choice.

## Run the Installer

1. Open the folder where you extracted the Installer.
2. Double-click on `luna-installer.exe` to run the Installer.
3. You might run into a warning from Windows Defender SmartScreen. If you do, click on `More info` and then `Run anyway` to proceed.
   This is a standard warning for applications that are not signed or widely recognized by Microsoft.
4. A terminal window will open, and the Installer will start. If your browser does not automatically open a website,
   open it manually by visiting `http://localhost:3013`.

You can now follow the following steps to install TidaLuna [here](/install/installing).
