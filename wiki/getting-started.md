# Getting Started with TidaLuna

::: warning
TidaLuna currently only support the TIDAL desktop app on Windows, MacOS and the Tidal-Hifi app on Linux.
You might encounter issues on Linux as the app is fundamentally different from the official TIDAL desktop app.
:::

## Pre-requisites

Before you can use TidaLuna, you need to have the TIDAL desktop app installed on your system.
If you don't have it installed yet, you can download it from the [TIDAL website](https://tidal.com/download).

::: info
If you're on windows, make sure you are NOT using the Microsoft Store version of TIDAL, as it is not compatible with TidaLuna.
:::

If you aren't logged into the TIDAL app yet, we suggest you do so now before proceeding with the installation of TidaLuna.

## Installation

If you don't have TidaLuna installed yet, you can download the Installer from [here](https://github.com/jxnxsdev/TidaLuna-Installer/releases/latest).

In case you need help installing TidaLuna, you can find guides for each platform below:

- [Installing on Windows](/install/windows)
- [Installing on Linux](/install/linux)
- [Installing on MacOS](/install/mac)

## Post Installation

After you have installed TidaLuna, you can start the TIDAL app as usual.
You should now see a new option called "Luna Settings" when clicking the 3 dots in the top left corner of the TIDAL app.
