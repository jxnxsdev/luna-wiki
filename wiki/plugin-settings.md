## Plugin Settings

::: info
Sometimes, it can happen that the options of a plugin are not displayed correctly. In this case, you can try to disable and re-enable the plugin in the Plugins Tab. If that doesn't work, you can try to restart the TIDAL app.
:::

The Settings are listed per plugin. You can click on the plugin name to expand the settings and configure the plugin to your liking.
